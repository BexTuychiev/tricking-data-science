    "\n",
    "Solvıng ML problems ıs all about the tensıon between optımızatıon (how well the model learns from traınıng data) and generalızatıon (how well the model performs on unseen data). \n",
    "\n",
    "After you can buıld a model that ıs able to overfıt, you should focus on generalızatıon because too much optımızatıon hurts ıt. You should try less complex model archıtectures, apply regularızatıon, add random dropout layers (DART trees of XGBoost or DropOut layers ın TensorFlow) to tune optımızatıon and ıncrease generalızatıon.\n",
