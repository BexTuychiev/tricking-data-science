    "Max voting is a common ensembling technique that uses the majority of vote to label new classification samples. If we have three models with the following predictions in a binary classification problem:\n",

    "- Model 1 -> class 1\n",
    "- Model 2 -> class 2\n",
    "- Model 3 -> class 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The final prediction would be class 1. VotingClassifier of Sklearn can be used to build such an ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes a list of individual classifiers and ensembles them with the max voting technique when its \"voting\" parameter is set to \"hard\". When it is set to \"soft\", the ensemble uses predicted class probabilities and averages them and thresholds the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "VotingRegressor is the same as VotingClassifier when its \"voting\" is set to \"soft\" and works for regression."
