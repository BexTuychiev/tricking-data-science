    "What is a Group KFold cross validation and when should you use it? Hint: non-IID data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional CV techniques like KFold are all designed for IID data - independent and identically distributed. In other words, the process that generates each row of the dataset does not have a memory of the past samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, what if the data is non-IID?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the Google Brain Ventilator Pressure competiton on Kaggle, participants worked with a simulated dataset of lung pressure of sedated patients connected to a breathing pump.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row records several physical attributes of lungs as oxygen goes in and out. So, each \"breath\" of oxygen into the lungs has over 50 rows of measurements with a timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we can't use plain-old KFold because the dataset is grouped into thousands of breaths and each breath has more than 50 records. Using KFold has the danger of cutting the dataset \"mid-breath\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As a solution, you can use a CV technique called GroupKFold which accepts an additional \"groups\" argument that tells the estimator where the group IDs are stored in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the lungs dataset, the \"groups\" argument would accept the \"breath_id\" column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of GroupKFold in Sklearn.\n",
