    "Autocorrelation is the same as correlation coefficient but it is calculated between a series and its lagging version. Here, lagging means shifting the series a few periods behind, so the present values can be compared to their past. \n",
    "\n",
    "Autocorrelation can help discover great insights about the time series, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trend - when a clear trend exists in time series, autocorrelation goes up or down as you further shift the series\n",
    "2. Seasonality - if autocorrelation goes up and down in fixed periods, seasonality exists in the series.\n",
    "3. Predictability - high autocorrelation suggests strong predictive power of the series, meaning you can train on the past samples to predict the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make autocorrelation analysis easier, you can plot it using statsmodels. Below is an example autocorrelation plot of temperature in Celcius. As you would expect, there is a strong seasonality in the series, occuring at every 12 lags."
