    "\"To achieve the perfect fit, you must first overfit\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the reasons why:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it makes sense - you can't fight overfitting without a model that overfits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, it is a sign of power - if a model is overfitting or perfectly memorizing the training data, it is a sign that model has enough optimization power to learn the patterns in the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Solving ML problems is all about the tension between optimization (how well the model learns from training data) and generalization (how well the model performs on unseen data). \n",
    "\n",
    "After you can build a model that is able to overfit, you should focus on generalization because too much optimization hurts it. You should try less complex model architectures, apply regularization, add random dropout layers (DART trees of XGBoost or DropOut layers in TensorFlow) to tune optimization and increase generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't be able to do any of them unless you have a model that overfits."

    "Last year, I saw that a tabular competition on Kaggle was won by an ensemble of Quadratic Discriminant Analysis models. What is QDA, you ask? I had no idea either.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a very eye-opening experience for me as a beginner, because I have thought having learned XGBoost, I could just ignore any other older models. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was disctracted by the hot tools. Turns out, it isn't about the tool but how quickly and efficiently you can solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, I found that for that particular competition's data, QDA was orders of magnitude faster than any tree-based models and could easily beat them in terms of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the moral here is that don't approach problems with tools-first mindset. Rather, find the best way to solve it in the simplest way possible. Don't try to look \"cool\" by using whatever is being popular at the time."

A good ensemble contains members with as different learning functions as possible that explore the information space created by the data from all angles.
